# CReAMA_Component_Framework


Developers of mobile collaborative  systems  deal  with  many technical  issues, in  addition  to  the  usual  difficulties  for collaborative  systems  development. In the paper also developed,  we  evaluate CReAMA, a  reference  architecture  defined  to  guide  the development of component-based mobile collaborative systems, by means of its use in the development of two mobile clients of a collaborative application.

The basic idea was to assemble a system, or in another level, confgure it, in a component based structure. With less effort in programming the system, we can focus on build (or assemble) the collaborative system.

**CReAMA_Component_Framework - Mobile Collaborative Project**

Proof of Concept developed (2014) with Java:
- Native Android (client side - component based); 
- VRaptor and Spring (server side).
