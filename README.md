# CReAMA_Component_Framework


Developers of mobile collaborative  systems  deal  with  many technical  issues, in  addition  to  the  usual  difficulties  for collaborative  systems  development. In  this  paper,  we  evaluate CReAMA, a  reference  architecture  defined  to  guide  the development of component-based mobile collaborative systems, by means of its use in the development of two mobile clients of a collaborative application.
